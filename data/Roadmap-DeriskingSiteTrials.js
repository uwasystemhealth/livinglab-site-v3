			'The University of Western Australia has significant industrial scale infrastructure on its campuses. Examples of equipment on the Crawley campus include large air compressors, cooling towers, tanks and 90KW pumps associated with the Chilled Water facility as well as numerous equipment, protocols and support functions associated with managing a complex facility. The Shenton Park Field Station campus, located 10 minutes away, has 67 hectares of outdoor and agricultural field activities with numerous tanks, piping and pump infrastructure as well as mobile equipment such as tractors.<br/><br/>We have the ability to place sensors onto industrial scale campus equipment in order to measure asset health, performance or other asset related features.<br/><br/>No interruption to facilities critical to the operation of the University is anticipated, and access to and installation of all equipment will have to pass appropriate safety and risk assessments. This will be managed as part of the Living Lab onboarding process in compliance with campus industry-matched risk and safety management systems. The electronic equipment anticipated for testing includes novel thickness, noise, vibration and similar transducers, robotic inspection units, and energy harvesting, wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices. There is potential to explore control, robotic maintenance and other options with non-critical campus equipment.',
